[WOTC] Iridar's Quantum Mystic Class

Adds new soldier class, Quantum Mystic, and three tiers of Mystic Staves, their primary weapons. Quantum Mystics are more rare than your regular soldiers.

[b]Primary Weapons[/b] - Mystic Staff (added by the mod). Mystic Staves are upgraded by sword schematics.
[b]Secondary Weapons[/b] - none
[b]Armor[/b] - Reaper Armor


[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]

Just trust me on this and don't add this soldier class to Ironman campaigns.
