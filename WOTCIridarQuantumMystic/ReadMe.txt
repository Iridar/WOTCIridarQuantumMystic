[WOTC] Iridar's Quantum Mystic Class

Adds new soldier class, Quantum Mystic, and three tiers of Mystic Staves, their primary weapons. 

Quantum Mystics are available through regular promotions, albeit slightly more rare than your regular soldiers.

[b]Primary Weapons[/b] - Mystic Staff (added by the mod, upgraded by sword schematics)
[b]Secondary Weapons[/b] - none
[b]Armor[/b] - Reaper Armor

[h1]ABILITIES[/h1]

[b]Quantum Mysticism[/b] is the bread and butter ability of any aspiring Quantum Mystic. What does it do? What doesn't it do! Damage enemies, heal wounds, strengthen body and soul, cure illnesses.. all through the power of the mind and manifestation of one's desires. Or at least Quantum Mystics claim so.

Quantum Mysticism does not cost any action points, and it can be used once per turn.

Other abilities of Quantum Mystics are practically limitless, just try it and you will see for yourself. The only important thing is to believe. Doesn't that make sense?

Safe to add mid-campaign. Just trust me on this and don't add this soldier class to Ironman campaigns.
